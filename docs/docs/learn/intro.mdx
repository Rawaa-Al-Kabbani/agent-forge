Welcome to the **Agent Forge** documentation! This section is designed to help you learn everything you need to know to build powerful and sophisticated AI agents using our framework.

Agent Forge is a TypeScript-based framework that simplifies the development, orchestration, and management of AI agents integrated with Large Language Models (LLMs). Whether you're a seasoned AI developer or just starting, our goal is to provide you with clear, concise, and practical guidance.

## What You'll Learn

In this "Learn" section, we'll cover:

*   **Getting Started:** How to install Agent Forge and build your very first agent.
*   **Core Concepts:** Deep dives into the fundamental building blocks like Agents, Tools, LLM integrations, and configuration.
*   **Practical Examples:** Step-by-step tutorials based on real-world use cases, showcasing how to leverage Agent Forge for various tasks.
*   **Advanced Topics:** Techniques for building more complex agentic workflows, multi-agent systems, and custom extensions.

## Prerequisites

Before you dive in, we recommend having a basic understanding of:

*   Node.js and npm/yarn
*   TypeScript (though many examples can be understood with JavaScript knowledge)
*   General concepts of AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)
