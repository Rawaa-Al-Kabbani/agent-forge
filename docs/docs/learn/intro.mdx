# Welcome to Agent Forge

Welcome to **Agent Forge** ‚Äì a powerful TypeScript framework designed to simplify the creation, orchestration, and deployment of AI agents using a modern decorator-based architecture.

Agent Forge enables developers to build sophisticated AI systems through declarative patterns that make complex agent orchestration as simple as adding decorators to classes.

## What You'll Learn

In this "Learn" section, we'll cover:

*   **Getting Started:** How to install Agent Forge and create your first agent using decorators
*   **Core Concepts:** Deep dives into the decorator-based architecture, agent classes, tools, and orchestration patterns
*   **Practical Examples:** Step-by-step tutorials showing real-world applications
*   **Advanced Topics:** Complex multi-agent systems, A2A communication, RAG integration, and plugin development

## Why Agent Forge?

### üéØ **Decorator-Driven Development**
Define agents, tools, and configurations using simple, intuitive decorators:

```typescript
@agent({
  name: "Research Assistant",
  role: "Research Specialist",
  description: "An AI agent that specializes in research and analysis",
  objective: "Find accurate and relevant information on any topic",
  model: "gpt-4",
  temperature: 0.7
})
class ResearchAgent extends Agent {}
```

### üîß **Effortless Tool Integration**
Add capabilities to your agents with zero boilerplate:

```typescript
@tool(WebSearchTool)
@tool(CalculatorTool)
@agent({ /* config */ })
class AssistantAgent extends Agent {}
```

### üåê **Built-in Agent-to-Agent Communication**
Enable distributed agent systems with simple decorators:

```typescript
@a2aClient({ serverUrl: "http://localhost:3000/a2a" })
class RemoteAgent extends Agent {}

@a2aServer({ port: 3000 })
class ServerAgent extends Agent {}
```

### üìö **Seamless RAG Integration**
Add knowledge base capabilities instantly:

```typescript
@RAGChromaDb({
  collectionName: "knowledge_base",
  chromaUrl: "http://localhost:8000",
  topK: 5
})
@agent({ /* config */ })
class KnowledgeAgent extends Agent {}
```

### üîÑ **Powerful Orchestration**
Create teams and workflows that coordinate multiple agents:

```typescript
@llmProvider("openai", { apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY })
@forge()
class MyApplication {
  static forge: AgentForge;

  static async run() {
    await readyForge(MyApplication, [ManagerAgent, ResearchAgent, WriterAgent]);
    
    const team = MyApplication.forge
      .createTeam("ManagerAgent")
      .addAgent(MyApplication.forge.getAgent("ResearchAgent")!)
      .addAgent(MyApplication.forge.getAgent("WriterAgent")!);
      
    const result = await team.run("Create a comprehensive report on AI trends");
  }
}
```

### ‚ö° **Advanced Features Out of the Box**
- **Rate Limiting:** Built-in API rate limiting with `@RateLimiter`
- **Visualization:** Execution timeline tracking with `@Visualizer`
- **Plugins:** Extensible plugin system with `@plugin`
- **MCP Integration:** Model Context Protocol support with `@MCP`
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Prerequisites

Before you dive in, we recommend having a basic understanding of:

*   Node.js and npm/yarn
*   TypeScript (especially decorators)
*   General concepts of AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)
