# What is Agent Forge?

Agent Forge is a modern TypeScript framework for building AI agent systems using a **decorator-based architecture**. It simplifies the creation of single agents, multi-agent teams, and distributed agent networks.

## Key Features

### Decorator-Driven Development
- **@agent** - Define agents with configuration
- **@tool** - Add capabilities to agents  
- **@llmProvider** - Configure LLM connections
- **@forge** - Initialize your application

### Multi-Agent Orchestration
- **Teams** - Hierarchical agent coordination
- **Workflows** - Sequential agent execution
- **A2A Protocol** - Distributed agent networks

### Rich Ecosystem
- **Built-in Tools** - Web search, content extraction
- **MCP Integration** - Model Context Protocol support
- **RAG Support** - Knowledge base integration
- **Plugin System** - Extensible architecture

## Architecture Overview

Agent Forge uses modern TypeScript decorators to provide a clean, declarative way to build agent systems:

```typescript
@tool(WebSearchTool)
@agent({
  name: "Research Assistant",
  role: "Research Specialist", 
  description: "Finds and analyzes information",
  objective: "Provide accurate research results",
  model: "gpt-4",
  temperature: 0.4
})
class ResearchAgent extends Agent {}

@llmProvider("openai", { apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY })
@forge()
class MyApplication {
  static forge: AgentForge;
  
  static async run() {
    const agent = new ResearchAgent();
    const result = await agent.run("Research the latest AI trends");
    console.log(result.output);
  }
}

await MyApplication.run();
```

## Why Decorator-Based?

The decorator approach provides several advantages:

- **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript support with IntelliSense
- **Clean Code** - Configuration separated from logic  
- **Composition** - Mix and match decorators as needed
- **Scalability** - Easy to manage complex agent systems
