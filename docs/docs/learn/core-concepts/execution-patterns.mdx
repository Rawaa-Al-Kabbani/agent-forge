# Execution Patterns: Workflows & Teams

Agent Forge supports flexible execution patterns to orchestrate multiple agents, allowing you to build sophisticated applications. The two primary patterns highlighted are **Sequential Workflows** and **Hierarchical Teams**.

## Sequential Workflows

Workflows in Agent Forge enable you to define a sequence of agents that execute tasks one after another. The output of one agent can potentially serve as the input for the next, allowing for a step-by-step problem-solving process.

**Use Cases:**

*   **Multi-stage processing:** Research a topic with one agent, summarize the findings with another, and then translate the summary with a third.
*   **Data transformation pipelines:** An agent extracts data, another cleans it, and a third analyzes it.
*   **Guided task completion:** Breaking down a complex task into smaller, manageable steps, each handled by a specialized agent in sequence.

**Defining and Running a Workflow:**

```typescript
import { Workflow, AgentForge, LLM, Agent } from "agent-forge"; // Assuming Agent is part of agent-forge or imported correctly
import dotenv from 'dotenv';

dotenv.config();

async function runWorkflowExample() {
  const apiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;
  if (!apiKey) {
    console.error("OPENAI_API_KEY not set. Please set it in your .env file.");
    return;
  }

  const llmProvider = new LLM("openai", { apiKey });
  const forge = new AgentForge(llmProvider);

  // Load agent definitions from YAML (ensure these files exist and are valid)
  // Example: ./research-agent.yaml, ./summary-agent.yaml
  // Ensure these YAML files define agents compatible with the llmProvider (e.g., correct model names)
  const researchAgent = await forge.loadAgent("./research-agent.yaml");
  const summaryAgent = await forge.loadAgent("./summary-agent.yaml");

  // Create a workflow
  const workflow = new Workflow("ResearchAndSummarizeWorkflow") // Optional: Name your workflow
    .addStep(researchAgent) // First agent in the sequence
    .addStep(summaryAgent);  // Second agent in the sequence

  try {
    // The initial input is passed to the first agent in the workflow.
    const result = await workflow.run(
      "Explain quantum computing advancements in 2023"
    );
    console.log("\nWorkflow Final Result:", result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error running workflow:", error);
  }
}

// To run this example:
// runWorkflowExample().catch(console.error);
```

**Key characteristics:**

*   Agents are added to the workflow in the desired order of execution.
*   The `workflow.run()` method initiates the sequence, passing the initial input to the first agent.
*   The framework manages the flow of information between agents (details of this data flow would be specific to Agent Forge's implementation).

## Hierarchical Teams

Teams in Agent Forge allow for a hierarchical execution model, where a **manager agent** delegates tasks to a group of specialized **member agents**. The manager is responsible for breaking down a larger objective, assigning sub-tasks, and potentially synthesizing the results from member agents.

**Use Cases:**

*   **Complex problem solving:** A manager agent coordinates a coder agent, a QA agent, and a documentation agent to develop a software feature.
*   **Creative generation:** A manager agent directs a writer agent, an artist agent, and a layout agent to produce a marketing brochure.
*   **Distributed task execution:** A manager assigns different research aspects of a broad topic to multiple specialist research agents.

**Defining and Running a Team:**

```typescript
import { Team, AgentForge, LLM, Agent } from "agent-forge"; // Assuming Agent is part of agent-forge or imported correctly
import dotenv from 'dotenv';

dotenv.config();

async function runTeamExample() {
  const apiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;
  if (!apiKey) {
    console.error("OPENAI_API_KEY not set. Please set it in your .env file.");
    return;
  }

  const llmProvider = new LLM("openai", { apiKey });
  const forge = new AgentForge(llmProvider);

  // Load manager and specialized agents from YAML (ensure these files exist and are valid)
  // Example: ./manager-agent.yaml, ./code-agent.yaml, ./design-agent.yaml
  // Ensure these YAML files define agents compatible with the llmProvider
  const managerAgent = await forge.loadAgent("./manager-agent.yaml");
  const codeAgent = await forge.loadAgent("./code-agent.yaml");
  const designAgent = await forge.loadAgent("./design-agent.yaml");

  // Create a team with a manager
  const team = new Team(managerAgent, "ProductLandingPageTeam") // The first agent passed is the manager. Optional: Name your team.
    .addAgent(codeAgent)    // Member agent
    .addAgent(designAgent); // Another member agent

  try {
    const result = await team.run("Create a landing page for our new product");
    console.log("\nTeam Final Result:", result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error running team:", error);
  }
}

// To run this example:
// runTeamExample().catch(console.error);
```

**Key characteristics:**

*   A `Team` is initialized with a designated manager agent.
*   Other agents are added as members of the team.
*   When `team.run()` is called with an objective, the manager agent receives it. The manager then strategizes and delegates tasks to its member agents based on their roles and capabilities.
*   Agent Forge likely handles the communication and task management within the team structure.

These execution patterns provide developers with powerful constructs to design and implement complex multi-agent systems effectively.

## Next Steps

*   Learn about [LLM Integration](./llm-integration.mdx) to understand how agents connect to language models.
*   Dive into advanced features like [Rate Limiting](../advanced/rate-limiting.mdx) and [Streaming Support](../advanced/streaming-support.mdx) for these patterns.
