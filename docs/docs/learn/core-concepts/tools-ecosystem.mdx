# Tools Ecosystem in Agent Forge

Agents in Agent Forge become truly powerful when they can interact with the outside world or perform specialized tasks beyond simple text generation. This is achieved through a flexible **Tools Ecosystem**.

## Overview

Agent Forge allows you to equip your agents with various tools. These can be:

*   **Built-in Tools:** Common functionalities that might be provided by the framework (e.g., a basic web search, calculator).
*   **Custom Tools:** Tools you develop specifically for your application's needs.
*   **MCP-Provided Tools:** Tools made available from external servers via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

Agents can be configured (often in their YAML definition or programmatically) with a list of tools they are permitted to use. The LLM then decides which tool to use, and with what inputs, based on the user's query and the agent's objective.

## Creating Custom Tools

Agent Forge provides a structured way to define your own custom tools. The general approach involves the following steps:

1.  **Create a Custom Tool Class:**
    Your custom tool class should typically extend a base `Tool` class provided by Agent Forge. It needs to define its name, a description (which helps the LLM understand its purpose), parameters it accepts, and the core `run` logic.

    ```typescript
    // Example: src/tools/my-custom-tool.ts
    import { Tool, ToolParameter } from "agent-forge"; // Actual import paths might vary

    export class MyCustomTool extends Tool {
      constructor() {
        // Define the parameters your tool accepts
        const parameters: ToolParameter[] = [
          {
            name: "inputData",
            type: "string", // Parameter type (e.g., string, number, boolean)
            description: "The specific data or query for this tool to process.",
            required: true, // Whether this parameter is mandatory
          },
          // Add more parameters as needed
        ];
        
        // Call the super constructor with tool name, description, parameters, and output schema/description
        super(
          "MyCustomTool", 
          "A custom tool that processes some input data in a special way.", 
          parameters, 
          "Returns a JSON object with the processing status and the input received."
        );
      }

      // Implement the core logic of your tool
      protected async run(params: { inputData: string }): Promise<any> {
        // console.log(`MyCustomTool received: ${params.inputData}`);
        
        // Your custom tool logic here
        // This could involve calling an API, performing calculations, accessing a database, etc.
        const result = { 
          status: "processed successfully", 
          originalInput: params.inputData,
          processedDetail: `Data '${params.inputData}' was handled by MyCustomTool.`
        };
        
        return result;
      }
    }
    ```

2.  **Register Your Custom Tool:**
    For an agent to use a tool, it must be made aware of it. Registration can happen in a couple of ways:

    *   **Globally with AgentForge Instance:** If you want the tool to be available to any agent managed by an `AgentForge` instance (especially those created via workflows or teams), you can register it directly with the `forge` instance.
        ```typescript
        import { AgentForge, LLM } from "agent-forge";
        import { MyCustomTool } from "./tools/my-custom-tool"; // Assuming MyCustomTool is defined as in the previous example
        import dotenv from 'dotenv';

        dotenv.config();

        function registerToolGlobally() {
          const apiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;
          if (!apiKey) {
            console.error("API Key not found for LLM provider.");
            return;
          }
          const llmProvider = new LLM("openai", { apiKey });
          const forge = new AgentForge(llmProvider);
          
          const myToolInstance = new MyCustomTool();
          forge.registerTool(myToolInstance);
          // console.log(`Tool '${myToolInstance.name}' registered globally with AgentForge.`);
          
          // Now, any agent loaded or managed by 'forge' can be configured to use "MyCustomTool"
          // by referencing its name in its YAML definition or tool list.
        }

        // To run this example:
        // registerToolGlobally();
        ```

    *   **Directly with an Agent:** You can also provide tool instances directly to an agent when creating it programmatically.
        ```typescript
        import { Agent, LLM } from "agent-forge"; 
        import { MyCustomTool } from "./tools/my-custom-tool"; // Assuming MyCustomTool is defined
        import dotenv from 'dotenv';

        dotenv.config();

        function assignToolDirectlyToAgent() {
          const apiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;
          if (!apiKey) {
            console.error("API Key not found for LLM provider.");
            return;
          }
          const llmProvider = new LLM("openai", { apiKey });
          const myToolInstance = new MyCustomTool();
          
          const agentWithCustomTool = new Agent({
            name: "AgentWithCustomTool",
            role: "Specialized Assistant",
            objective: "Perform tasks using MyCustomTool",
            model: "gpt-4", // Ensure model compatibility
            llm: llmProvider,
            tools: [myToolInstance], // Provide tool instance directly
          });
          // console.log(`Agent '${agentWithCustomTool.name}' created with '${myToolInstance.name}' assigned directly.`);

          // This agent can now use MyCustomTool when it runs, e.g.:
          // async function runAgent() {
          //   const result = await agentWithCustomTool.run("Use MyCustomTool to process 'some data'.");
          //   console.log(result);
          // }
          // runAgent();
        }

        // To run this example:
        // assignToolDirectlyToAgent();
        ```
        You can also programmatically add tools using a method like `agent.addTool(myTool)`.

3.  **Use in Agent YAML (if applicable):**
    If you are defining agents via YAML, you can list your custom tool by its registered name:
    ```yaml
    # agent-using-custom-tool.yaml
    name: MySpecialAgent
    # ... other properties
    tools:
      - name: MyCustomTool
        description: Processes custom data in a special way.
      - name: WebSearch
        description: Search the web for information.
    ```
    When `AgentForge` loads this YAML, it will look for a tool named "MyCustomTool" in its `ToolRegistry`.

## Tool Parameters and Descriptions

*   **Parameters (`ToolParameter`):** Clearly defining your tool's parameters (name, type, description, required status) is crucial. This information is often used by the LLM to understand how to call your tool correctly.
*   **Tool Description:** The overall description of the tool (provided in the `super()` call) helps the LLM decide *when* to use your tool from a list of available tools.
*   **Output Schema/Description:** Describing what your tool returns helps the LLM (and your application code) understand the tool's output.

By creating and integrating custom tools, you can significantly enhance the capabilities of your AI agents, allowing them to perform a wide range of complex tasks.
