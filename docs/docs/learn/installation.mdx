# Installation

Getting Agent Forge set up in your project is straightforward. You can install it using your preferred Node.js package manager, Yarn or npm.

## Prerequisites

*   **Node.js:** Agent Forge requires Node.js. We recommend using version 18.x or higher. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **Package Manager:** You'll need either Yarn (version 1.x or newer) or npm (usually comes with Node.js).

## Installing Agent Forge

Navigate to your project's root directory in your terminal and run one of the following commands:

### Using Yarn

```bash
yarn add agent-forge
```

### Using npm

```bash
npm install agent-forge
```

### Using pnpm

```bash
pnpm add agent-forge
```

This will add `agent-forge` to your project's dependencies.

## Setting up Environment Variables (Recommended)

Many AI agents require API keys for Large Language Models (LLMs) or other services. Agent Forge often uses environment variables to configure these.

**⚠️ Security Note:** Never hardcode API keys directly in your source code. Always use environment variables to keep your keys secure and prevent them from being accidentally committed to version control.

It's a good practice to use a `.env` file to manage your API keys and other sensitive information. Install the `dotenv` package if you haven't already:

### Using Yarn
```bash
yarn add dotenv
```

### Using npm
```bash
npm install dotenv
```

Then, create a `.env` file in the root of your project:

```env
# .env file
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
# Add other API keys or configurations as needed
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_anthropic_api_key_here"
```

**Important:** Remember to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent committing your API keys to version control.

```gitignore
# .gitignore
.env
```

In your application code (usually at the entry point, like `index.ts` or `app.ts`), you can then load these environment variables:

```typescript
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
dotenv.config();

// Your Agent Forge application logic starts here
```

## Next Steps

With Agent Forge installed and your environment potentially configured, you're ready to build your first agent!
