# Debugging Agent Interactions

Agent Forge includes features to help you debug and understand the interactions within your agent systems, particularly for `Team` executions. Verbose logging provides a detailed trace of the execution flow.

## Enabling Verbose Logging

You can enable verbose logging by passing the `verbose: true` option to the `run()` method of a `Team` (and potentially `Workflow`, though the example focuses on `Team`). This option provides a detailed trace of the execution flow.

```typescript
import { AgentForge, LLM, Agent, Team } from "agent-forge";
import dotenv from 'dotenv';

dotenv.config();

async function runTeamWithVerboseLogging() {
  const apiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;
  if (!apiKey) {
    console.error("API Key not found. Please set OPENAI_API_KEY in your .env file.");
    return;
  }

  const llmProvider = new LLM("openai", { apiKey });
  // const forge = new AgentForge(llmProvider); // Optional: forge can manage agents and tools

  // Define your agents (replace with your actual agent configurations or loading from YAML)
  const managerAgent = new Agent({
    name: "Manager",
    role: "Overseer",
    objective: "Manage tasks and synthesize results",
    model: "gpt-4", // Ensure this model is compatible with your provider and API key
    llm: llmProvider
  });

  const researchAgent = new Agent({
    name: "Researcher",
    role: "Investigator",
    objective: "Find accurate and relevant information",
    model: "gpt-4",
    llm: llmProvider
  });

  const summaryAgent = new Agent({
    name: "Summarizer",
    role: "Condenser",
    objective: "Summarize lengthy texts into concise points",
    model: "gpt-4",
    llm: llmProvider
  });

  const team = new Team(managerAgent)
    .addAgent(researchAgent)
    .addAgent(summaryAgent);

  try {
    // console.log("Running team with verbose logging...");
    const result = await team.run(
      "What are the ethical implications of AI in healthcare?",
      { verbose: true } // Enable verbose logging for this team execution
    );
    console.log("\\nFinal result:", result.output);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error running team:", error);
  }
}

// To run this example, call the function:
// runTeamWithVerboseLogging();
```

## Understanding Verbose Output

Verbose output typically includes:

*   **Team Initialization:** Confirmation of the team starting, number of agents, and the manager.
*   **Task Assignment:** The overall task given to the team.
*   **Manager's Plan:** Initial thoughts or plan from the manager agent.
*   **Sub-task Creation:** Details of specific sub-tasks created by the manager and assigned to member agents, including any dependencies.
*   **Agent Execution:** Indication of when a specific agent starts and completes a task, often with the agent's name and the task ID.
*   **Agent Output/Findings:** The actual output or result produced by an agent for its assigned sub-task.
*   **Progress Reports:** Summaries of completed tasks and their results, which the manager might use for further planning.
*   **Manager's Iterations:** Subsequent instructions or new tasks assigned by the manager based on the progress and results from member agents.
*   **Final Result Generation:** Indication that all tasks are completed and the manager is generating the final output.
*   **Execution Summary:** Confirmation of successful completion and potentially timing information.

**Example Verbose Output:**

```
üöÄ Starting team execution with 2 agents and 1 manager
üìã Task: "What are the ethical implications of AI in healthcare?"

üë®‚Äçüíº Manager (Initial Plan):
Assigning tasks to team members...

üîÑ System: Created task task-0 for Researcher: Research current AI applications in healthcare
üìå Dependencies: none

‚è≥ Starting task task-0 for agent "Researcher"...
üë§ Researcher (Task task-0):
[Research findings...]
‚úÖ Task task-0 completed in 2.34s

üìä Progress Report:
Completed Tasks:
- Task task-0 (Researcher): [Research results...]

üë®‚Äçüíº Manager:
[Next instructions...]

üèÅ All tasks completed. Generating final result...
‚úÖ Team execution completed successfully
```

## Combining with Other Options

Verbose logging can be combined with other execution options, such as `rate_limit`:

```typescript
// This snippet assumes an initialized 'team' instance as shown in the example above.
// If running this standalone, you would need to include the setup for 
// apiKey, llmProvider, agent definitions, and team instantiation.

async function runTeamWithVerboseAndRateLimit(teamInstance: Team) {
  if (!teamInstance) {
    console.error("Team instance not provided.");
    return;
  }
  try {
    // console.log("Running team with verbose logging and rate limiting...");
    const result = await teamInstance.run(
      "Explain the impact of blockchain on financial systems",
      {
        rate_limit: 15, // Limit to 15 LLM calls per minute
        verbose: true,    // Enable detailed logging
      }
    );
    console.log("\\nFinal result:", result.output);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error running team with rate limit:", error);
  }
}

// To run this example, you would first get a team instance:
// const previouslyCreatedTeam = team; // From the example above
// if (previouslyCreatedTeam) {
//   runTeamWithVerboseAndRateLimit(previouslyCreatedTeam);
// }
```

Using verbose logging is invaluable for:

*   Understanding the step-by-step execution flow within a team.
*   Identifying bottlenecks or issues in agent communication or task handoff.
*   Verifying that agents are performing their roles as expected.
*   Fine-tuning manager prompts and member agent capabilities.
