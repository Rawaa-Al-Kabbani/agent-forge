# Tutorial: Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication

Welcome to the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication tutorial for Agent Forge!

This tutorial will guide you through setting up and running a practical example of A2A communication using Agent Forge in your own project. You'll learn how to:

1.  **Host an Agent using `A2AServer`**: Make an Agent Forge agent from your project available over a network.
2.  **Interact with a Hosted Agent using `RemoteA2AAgent`**: Create a client-side proxy in your project to communicate with the hosted agent.
3.  **Integrate a Remote Agent into a `Team`**: See how a local "manager" agent in your project can delegate tasks to a remote agent as part of a collaborative team.

A2A communication allows you to build distributed multi-agent systems where agents can reside on different processes or even different machines, opening up possibilities for more complex and scalable applications.

## What You'll Build

You will create two TypeScript files in your own project:

*   `my-a2a-server.ts`: This script will set up an A2A Server to host a `HelpfulAssistantAgent`.
*   `my-a2a-team.ts`: This script will create a `RemoteA2AAgent` to connect to your server and then use this remote agent within a `Team`, where a local `OrchestrationManagerAgent` delegates a task to it.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following set up in your development environment:

*   **Node.js and NPM/Yarn**: Ensure Node.js (preferably a recent LTS version) and a package manager (npm or yarn) are installed.
*   **TypeScript Project**: It's recommended to work within a TypeScript project. If you don't have one, you can quickly set one up:
    ```bash
    mkdir my-agent-forge-project
    cd my-agent-forge-project
    npm init -y
    npm install typescript @types/node ts-node --save-dev
    # or
    # yarn add typescript @types/node ts-node --dev
    npx tsc --init # Creates a tsconfig.json
    ```
*   **Agent Forge Installed**: Install Agent Forge into your project:
    ```bash
    npm install agent-forge
    # or
    # yarn add agent-forge
    ```
*   **LLM API Key**: The examples rely on an LLM. Ensure your `OPENAI_API_KEY` (or equivalent for your chosen LLM provider) is set as an environment variable. The scripts will prompt you if it's missing.
    ```bash
    # Example for Bash/Zsh - add to your .bashrc, .zshrc, or run in your terminal session
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
    ```
    For Windows, you might use `set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here` in Command Prompt or `$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"` in PowerShell.

## Tutorial Steps

This tutorial is divided into the following parts. You'll be creating the files and running them from your project directory (e.g., `my-agent-forge-project`).

1.  [**Setting up the A2A Server**](/docs/learn/a2a-tutorial/setting-up-a2a-server): Create and run `my-a2a-server.ts` to host an agent.
2.  [**Creating the A2A Client and Team**](/docs/learn/a2a-tutorial/creating-a2a-client-and-team): Create and run `my-a2a-team.ts` to connect to the server and see agents collaborate.

Let's get started!
