# Part 2: Creating Your A2A Client and Team

Now that your A2A server (`my-a2a-server.ts`) is running and hosting the `HelpfulAssistantAgent`, it's time to set up a client in your project to interact with it. In this part, we'll create a script named `my-a2a-team.ts` to demonstrate how a `RemoteA2AAgent` can connect to your server and how this remote agent can be integrated into an Agent Forge `Team`.

## Creating Your A2A Team Script (`my-a2a-team.ts`)

In your project directory, create a new file named `my-a2a-team.ts`.

Copy and paste the following code into this file:

```typescript
import { Agent, AgentForge, LLM, Team, RemoteA2AAgent } from "agent-forge";
import type { AgentConfig, A2AClientOptions } from "agent-forge";

async function runMyA2ATeamExample() {
    const serverUrl = "http://localhost:41241/a2a"; // Ensure this matches your server
    console.log(`INFO: Make sure your A2A Server (my-a2a-server.ts) is running and accessible at ${serverUrl}`);

    // 1. LLM Configuration (for the local Manager Agent)
    const llmConfig = {
      apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY || "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE",
    };
    if (!llmConfig.apiKey || llmConfig.apiKey === "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE") {
      console.error("ERROR: OpenAI API key is not configured. Please set OPENAI_API_KEY or update the script.");
      process.exit(1);
    }
    const llmProvider = new LLM("openai", llmConfig);

    // 2. AgentForge Instance (optional, but good practice if you use other forge features)
    const forge = new AgentForge(llmProvider);

    // 3. Define and Instantiate a local Manager Agent
    const managerAgentConfig: AgentConfig = {
        name: "OrchestrationManagerAgent",
        role: "Orchestration Manager",
        description: "A manager agent that delegates tasks to specialized assistant agents in its team.",
        objective: "Your goal is to answer the user\'s query by appropriately delegating tasks to your team members. You have a team member who is a general helpful assistant. Use that assistant for general queries.",
        model: "gpt-4-turbo", // Manager might use a more powerful model
    };
    const managerAgent = new Agent(managerAgentConfig, [], llmProvider);
    // forge.registerAgent(managerAgent); // If you want to register it with the forge

    // 4. Instantiate RemoteA2AAgent to connect to your server agent
    let helpfulAssistantRemoteAgent: RemoteA2AAgent;
    try {
        const clientOptions: A2AClientOptions = {
            serverUrl: serverUrl,
        };
        // The RemoteA2AAgent will fetch its name, description, etc., from your server's Agent Card.
        helpfulAssistantRemoteAgent = await RemoteA2AAgent.create(clientOptions);
        console.log(`INFO: Remote agent '${helpfulAssistantRemoteAgent.name}' (connected to your server) initialized. Description: ${helpfulAssistantRemoteAgent.description}`);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`ERROR: Failed to create RemoteA2AAgent to connect to ${serverUrl}.`);
        if (error instanceof Error) {
            console.error(`Details: ${error.message}`);
            if (error.message.includes('ECONNREFUSED')) {
                console.error("Hint: Is your my-a2a-server.ts running?");
            }
        } else {
            console.error("An unknown error occurred:", error);
        }
        process.exit(1);
    }

    // 5. Create a Team with the local manager and the remote assistant
    const team = new Team(managerAgent).addAgent(helpfulAssistantRemoteAgent);
    
    // 6. Define a task for the Team
    const taskForTeam = "What is the capital of France?";
    console.log(`INFO: Sending task to Team (Manager: ${managerAgent.name}): "${taskForTeam}"`);

    try {
        const result = await team.run(taskForTeam, { verbose: true });

        console.log("\n--- Team Final Output ---");
        if (result.output) {
            console.log(result.output);
        } else {
            console.log("(Team did not provide a final textual output)");
        }

        if (result.metadata?.toolCalls && result.metadata.toolCalls.length > 0) {
            console.log("\n(Manager Agent tool calls/delegations during its execution):");
            result.metadata.toolCalls.forEach(tc => {
                console.log(`  Tool: ${tc.toolName}, Params: ${JSON.stringify(tc.parameters)}, Result: ${tc.result}`);
            });
        }

    } catch (error) {
        console.error("\n--- ERROR during Team execution ---");
        if (error instanceof Error) {
            console.error(`Error: ${error.message}`);
        } else {
            console.error("An unknown error occurred:", error);
        }
        process.exit(1);
    }

    console.log("\nTeam example finished successfully!");
}

runMyA2ATeamExample();
```

**Key points about this client script:**

*   **Imports**: It imports necessary components like `Agent`, `Team`, `RemoteA2AAgent` from `agent-forge`.
*   **Manager Agent**: A local `OrchestrationManagerAgent` is set up. Its objective is to delegate tasks.
*   **`RemoteA2AAgent.create()`**: This is the core of the client-side A2A. It connects to the `serverUrl` (where your `my-a2a-server.ts` is running). It automatically fetches the Agent Card from your server to configure the remote agent proxy (name, description, etc.).
*   **Team Creation**: The local manager and the `helpfulAssistantRemoteAgent` (proxy to your server agent) are combined into a `Team`.
*   **Task Delegation**: When `team.run()` is called, the manager agent should decide to delegate the task to the remote assistant.

## Running Your A2A Team Example

1.  **Ensure Your Server is Running**: The `my-a2a-server.ts` script from [Part 1](./setting-up-a2a-server.mdx) must be running in a separate terminal.
2.  **Open a Second Terminal**: Navigate to your project directory (e.g., `my-agent-forge-project`) where you saved `my-a2a-team.ts`.
3.  **API Key**: Ensure your `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set.
4.  **Run the Team Script**:
    Using `ts-node`:
    ```bash
    npx ts-node my-a2a-team.ts
    ```
    Or, compile first with `tsc` then run with `node`:
    ```bash
    npx tsc my-a2a-team.ts
    node my-a2a-team.js
    ```

## Expected Client Output

In the terminal running `my-a2a-team.ts`, you should see output similar to:

```text
INFO: Make sure your A2A Server (my-a2a-server.ts) is running and accessible at http://localhost:41241/a2a
INFO: Remote agent 'HelpfulAssistantAgent' (connected to your server) initialized. Description: An AI assistant that tries to be helpful, hosted via A2A.
INFO: Sending task to Team (Manager: OrchestrationManagerAgent): "What is the capital of France?"

(Verbose logging from the manager agent, showing its reasoning and delegation, will appear here if { verbose: true } is used for team.run())

--- Team Final Output ---
Paris

(Manager Agent tool calls/delegations during its execution):
  Tool: HelpfulAssistantAgent, Params: {"input":"What is the capital of France?"}, Result: Paris

Team example finished successfully!
```

*Key Observations:*
*   The script reminds you to have your server running.
*   It confirms the `RemoteA2AAgent` initialized using details from *your* server's Agent Card.
*   The manager delegates the task (you'll see `Tool: HelpfulAssistantAgent` in the tool calls).
*   The final answer from the remote agent is displayed.

Simultaneously, in the terminal running `my-a2a-server.ts`, you should see logs indicating it received and processed a task.

## How it All Connects (Recap)

1.  **`my-a2a-server.ts`**: You created an agent and exposed it via `A2AServer`.
2.  **`my-a2a-team.ts`**:
    *   Uses `RemoteA2AAgent.create()` to connect to *your* server.
    *   A local manager agent delegates a task to this `RemoteA2AAgent` (proxy).
    *   The proxy sends the task to your `A2AServer`, which invokes your hosted agent.
    *   The result is returned all the way back to your team script.

## Conclusion of Tutorial

Congratulations! You've successfully set up and run a complete Agent-to-Agent communication example within your own project using the `agent-forge` NPM package. You've learned how to:

-   Host an agent from your project using `A2AServer`.
-   Connect to it using `RemoteA2AAgent` and dynamically configure the client proxy using the server's Agent Card.
-   Integrate this remote agent into a local `Team` for collaborative, distributed task execution.

This A2A framework enables you to build sophisticated, distributed multi-agent systems. You can adapt these examples to host various specialized agents from your projects and design complex workflows.

Consider exploring:
-   Different agent configurations for your server and client.
-   Implementing the A2A streaming capabilities (currently a placeholder for the SSE client in `RemoteA2AAgent`).
-   Setting up multiple A2A servers hosting different agents.
