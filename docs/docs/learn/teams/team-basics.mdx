# Team Basics

Teams allow multiple agents to collaborate on complex tasks under the coordination of a manager agent. The manager breaks down tasks, assigns them to appropriate team members, and synthesizes the results.

## Creating a Team

Create a team by defining agent classes and using the `readyForge` function:

```typescript
import { Agent, agent, llmProvider, forge, readyForge } from "agent-forge";

// Define team members
@agent({
  name: "Researcher",
  role: "Research Specialist",
  description: "Finds and analyzes information",
  objective: "Provide accurate research results", 
  model: "gpt-4",
  temperature: 0.4
})
class ResearcherAgent extends Agent {}

@agent({
  name: "Writer", 
  role: "Content Writer",
  description: "Creates clear, engaging content",
  objective: "Write compelling articles and summaries",
  model: "gpt-4", 
  temperature: 0.7
})
class WriterAgent extends Agent {}

@agent({
  name: "Manager",
  role: "Team Manager", 
  description: "Coordinates team efforts",
  objective: "Effectively delegate tasks and synthesize results",
  model: "gpt-4",
  temperature: 0.6
})
class ManagerAgent extends Agent {}

// Initialize the team
@llmProvider("openai", { apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY })
@forge()
class MyTeam {
  static forge: AgentForge;
  
  static async run() {
    // Create team members
    const manager = new ManagerAgent();
    const researcher = new ResearcherAgent(); 
    const writer = new WriterAgent();
    
    // Create and run team
    const team = this.forge
      .createTeam("Manager")
      .addAgent(researcher)
      .addAgent(writer);
      
    const result = await team.run(
      "Research renewable energy trends and write a summary article"
    );
    
    console.log(result.output);
  }
}

// Initialize and run
await readyForge(MyTeam, [ManagerAgent, ResearcherAgent, WriterAgent]);
await MyTeam.run();
```

## How Teams Work

### 1. Task Delegation
The manager agent analyzes the input and breaks it into subtasks:
- Identifies which agents are best suited for each subtask
- Creates specific instructions for each team member
- Manages dependencies between tasks

### 2. Parallel Execution  
Team members work on their assigned tasks:
- Agents can work in parallel when tasks are independent
- Dependencies are automatically managed
- Each agent brings their specialized capabilities

### 3. Result Synthesis
The manager combines individual results:
- Reviews all agent outputs
- Synthesizes information into a coherent response
- Ensures the original objective is met

## Team Configuration

### Team Options
```typescript
const result = await team.run("Complex task", {
  verbose: true,           // Enable detailed logging
  stream: true,           // Enable real-time updates
  rate_limit: 30,         // Limit API calls per minute
  maxTurns: 5,           // Maximum conversation turns
  maxExecutionTime: 60000 // 60 second timeout
});
```

### Enabling Streaming
Watch team coordination in real-time:

```typescript
import { globalEventEmitter, AgentForgeEvents } from "agent-forge";

// Listen for team communications
globalEventEmitter.on(AgentForgeEvents.AGENT_COMMUNICATION, (event) => {
  console.log(`${event.sender}: ${event.message}`);
});

// Enable streaming
const result = await team.run("Research task", { 
  stream: true,
  enableConsoleStream: true // Built-in console visualization
});
```

## Team Roles and Specialization

### Research Team
```typescript
@tool(WebSearchTool)
@agent({
  name: "Web Researcher",
  role: "Web Research Specialist", 
  description: "Searches and analyzes web content",
  objective: "Find current, accurate information online",
  model: "gpt-4",
  temperature: 0.3
})
class WebResearcher extends Agent {}

@tool(WebPageContentTool)
@agent({
  name: "Content Analyst",
  role: "Content Analysis Expert",
  description: "Analyzes and extracts insights from documents", 
  objective: "Provide deep analysis of content",
  model: "gpt-4",
  temperature: 0.4
})
class ContentAnalyst extends Agent {}

@agent({
  name: "Research Manager",
  role: "Research Team Lead",
  description: "Coordinates research efforts",
  objective: "Ensure comprehensive, accurate research",
  model: "gpt-4", 
  temperature: 0.5
})
class ResearchManager extends Agent {}
```

### Analysis Team
```typescript
@agent({
  name: "Data Analyst", 
  role: "Data Analysis Specialist",
  description: "Analyzes data and identifies patterns",
  objective: "Extract actionable insights from data",
  model: "gpt-4",
  temperature: 0.2
})
class DataAnalyst extends Agent {}

@agent({
  name: "Report Writer",
  role: "Technical Writer", 
  description: "Creates clear, professional reports",
  objective: "Communicate findings effectively",
  model: "gpt-4",
  temperature: 0.6
})
class ReportWriter extends Agent {}
```

## Team Communication Patterns

### Manager Instructions
The manager provides specific, actionable instructions:

```typescript
// Manager automatically creates instructions like:
// "Researcher: Search for the latest renewable energy statistics and market trends"
// "Writer: Create a 500-word summary highlighting key findings and future outlook"
```

### Dependency Management
Tasks can depend on other tasks:

```typescript
// Manager handles dependencies automatically:
// 1. Researcher gathers information
// 2. Analyst reviews research (depends on step 1)  
// 3. Writer creates article (depends on steps 1 & 2)
```

## Error Handling and Recovery

Teams handle failures gracefully:

```typescript
const result = await team.run("Complex research task", {
  verbose: true // See detailed error information
});

// Check for any issues
if (result.metadata.toolCalls?.some(call => call.result?.error)) {
  console.log("Some tools failed, but team adapted");
}
```

## Team Performance Monitoring

### Execution Metrics
```typescript
const result = await team.run("Analysis task");

console.log(`Team execution time: ${result.metadata.executionTime}ms`);
console.log(`Tokens used: ${result.metadata.tokenUsage?.total}`);

// Individual agent performance is tracked automatically
```

### Verbose Logging
Enable detailed team coordination logs:

```typescript
const result = await team.run("Task", { 
  verbose: true // Shows manager-agent communications
});
```

## Best Practices

### Clear Agent Roles
Define specific, non-overlapping roles:

```typescript
// ✅ Good - Clear specialization
@agent({
  name: "Market Researcher",
  role: "Market Research Specialist",
  description: "Analyzes market trends and competitor data", 
  objective: "Provide actionable market insights",
  model: "gpt-4"
})

// ❌ Vague - Unclear differentiation
@agent({
  name: "Helper",
  role: "Assistant",
  description: "Helps with stuff",
  objective: "Be helpful",
  model: "gpt-4"  
})
```

### Balanced Team Composition
Include complementary skills:

```typescript
// Research + Analysis + Communication
const team = forge
  .createTeam("Manager")
  .addAgent(new ResearcherAgent())   // Information gathering
  .addAgent(new AnalystAgent())      // Data processing  
  .addAgent(new WriterAgent());      // Communication
```

### Appropriate Manager
Choose a capable model for the manager:

```typescript
@agent({
  name: "Manager",
  role: "Team Coordinator",
  description: "Manages complex multi-agent workflows",
  objective: "Coordinate team efforts for optimal results", 
  model: "gpt-4", // Use capable model for coordination
  temperature: 0.6 // Balanced creativity for task planning
})
class TeamManager extends Agent {}
```

### Task Clarity
Provide clear, specific tasks:

```typescript
// ✅ Good - Specific and actionable
await team.run(`
  Research the current state of electric vehicle adoption in Europe.
  Include market share data, government policies, and consumer trends.
  Write a 1000-word executive summary with key findings.
`);

// ❌ Vague - Hard to plan and execute
await team.run("Tell me about cars");
```

## Troubleshooting

### Team Deadlocks
If the team gets stuck:
- The manager automatically detects deadlocks
- Provides alternative task breakdowns
- Can cancel or modify stalled tasks

### Poor Coordination
If tasks aren't being assigned well:
- Check manager agent configuration
- Ensure team members have clear, distinct roles
- Verify the task is appropriate for team execution

### Performance Issues
If teams are slow:
- Use rate limiting to control API usage
- Consider simpler models for routine tasks
- Optimize agent prompts and configurations
