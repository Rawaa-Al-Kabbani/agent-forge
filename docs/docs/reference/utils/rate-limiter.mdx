The `RateLimiter` class provides a way to control the frequency of operations, ensuring that a specified number of calls per minute is not exceeded.

## `RateLimiterOptions` Interface

Defines the configuration options for a `RateLimiter` instance.

```typescript
export interface RateLimiterOptions {
  callsPerMinute: number; // The maximum number of calls allowed per minute.
  verbose?: boolean;       // Optional: If true, logs messages when the rate limit is hit and when a token becomes available.
}
```

## `RateLimiter` Class

### Constructor

```typescript
constructor(options: RateLimiterOptions)
```

Creates a new `RateLimiter` instance.

*   **`options: RateLimiterOptions`**: The configuration for the rate limiter. See [`RateLimiterOptions`](#ratelimiteroptions-interface).

### Methods

#### `async waitForToken(): Promise<void>`

This asynchronous method ensures that an operation does not proceed until a token is available according to the configured rate limit (`callsPerMinute`).

If tokens are available (i.e., the number of calls in the current one-minute window is below `callsPerMinute`), the method returns immediately.

If the rate limit has been reached, the method will pause execution (yielding via `await`) and wait until the start of the next one-minute window or until tokens are replenished. Calls to `waitForToken` are queued if multiple operations are waiting.

*   **Returns**: A `Promise` that resolves when a token is available and the operation can proceed.

### Example Usage

```typescript
import { RateLimiter } from "agent-forge"; // Assuming RateLimiter is exported

async function makeLimitedApiCalls() {
  const limiter = new RateLimiter({ callsPerMinute: 5, verbose: true });

  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    console.log(`Attempting to make API call #${i + 1}`);
    await limiter.waitForToken();
    console.log(`Making API call #${i + 1} now at ${new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}`);
    // Simulate API call
    // await fetch("https://api.example.com/data"); 
  }
  console.log("All API calls attempted.");
}

// makeLimitedApiCalls();
/*
Conceptual Output (timing will vary):
Attempting to make API call #1
Making API call #1 now at [TIME]
Attempting to make API call #2
Making API call #2 now at [TIME]
Attempting to make API call #3
Making API call #3 now at [TIME]
Attempting to make API call #4
Making API call #4 now at [TIME]
Attempting to make API call #5
Making API call #5 now at [TIME]
Attempting to make API call #6
(verbose log) ⏱️ Rate limit reached. Waiting [X]s for next available slot. 1 calls in queue.
(verbose log) ✅ Token potentially received, continuing execution...
Making API call #6 now at [TIME+X seconds]
...

```

This utility is useful for any scenario where you need to control the rate of outgoing requests or operations to avoid overwhelming a service or hitting API quotas.
