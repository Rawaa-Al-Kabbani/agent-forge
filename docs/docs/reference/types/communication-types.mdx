This page describes types related to agent communication, execution control, and event handling within Agent Forge.

## `Message` Interface

Represents a single message within an agent's conversation history. This structure is used for interacting with LLMs.

```typescript
export interface Message {
  role: "system" | "user" | "assistant" | "tool"; // The role of the message sender.
  content: string;                              // The textual content of the message.
  name?: string;                                 // Optional: Name of the user or tool, if applicable.

  // For assistant messages that include requests to call tools:
  tool_calls?: Array<{
    id: string;        // A unique ID for the tool call.
    type: "function";   // Type of the tool call, typically "function".
    function: {
      name: string;      // Name of the function/tool to call.
      arguments: string; // JSON string of arguments for the function.
    };
  }>;

  // For messages that are results of a tool call:
  tool_call_id?: string; // The ID of the tool call this message is a response to.
}
```

This interface is similar to `ChatCompletionMessageParam` from `token.js` but is specific to Agent Forge's internal representation.

## `ExecutionMode` Enum

Defines the different modes in which agents or groups of agents can be executed.

```typescript
export enum ExecutionMode {
  SEQUENTIAL = "sequential", // Agents run one after another, like in a Workflow.
  HIERARCHICAL = "hierarchical", // Agents collaborate under a manager, like in a Team.
}
```

Used by `AgentForge.runWithMode()` and influences how `managerOrFirstAgentName` and `memberAgentNames` parameters are interpreted.

## `AgentForgeEvents` Enum

Lists the various event types that are emitted by the framework, particularly via the `globalEventEmitter` or an `LLM` instance's event emitter. These can be used with `EventEmitter.on()` to subscribe to framework activities.

```typescript
export enum AgentForgeEvents {
  // Emitted when an agent sends a message, often in a team or workflow context.
  AGENT_COMMUNICATION = "agent:communication",
  
  // Emitted when a step in a Workflow completes.
  WORKFLOW_STEP_COMPLETE = "workflow:step_complete",
  
  // Emitted when a task assigned by a Team manager to a member agent is completed.
  TEAM_TASK_COMPLETE = "team:task_complete",
  
  // Emitted when an overall execution (agent run, workflow run, team run) finishes.
  EXECUTION_COMPLETE = "execution:complete",
  
  // Emitted for each chunk of data when an LLM response is being streamed.
  LLM_STREAM_CHUNK = "llm:stream_chunk",
  
  // Emitted when an LLM streaming response has fully completed.
  LLM_STREAM_COMPLETE = "llm:stream_complete",
}
```

See [`enableConsoleStreaming()`](../utils/streaming.mdx) for an example of how these events are used for logging.
Associated event data structures (e.g., `AgentCommunicationEvent`, `LLMStreamEvent`) provide the payload for these events. 

## `AgentCommunicationEvent` Interface

This interface defines the payload for the `AgentForgeEvents.AGENT_COMMUNICATION` event.

```typescript
export interface AgentCommunicationEvent {
  sender: string;        // The name of the agent or entity sending the message.
  recipient?: string;     // Optional: The name of the intended recipient agent.
  message: string;       // The content of the communication.
  timestamp: number;     // Unix timestamp (milliseconds) of when the event occurred.
}
```

## `LLMStreamEvent` Interface

This interface defines the payload for the `AgentForgeEvents.LLM_STREAM_CHUNK` event. It's also relevant for understanding the data provided up to the point of an `AgentForgeEvents.LLM_STREAM_COMPLETE` event.

```typescript
export interface LLMStreamEvent {
  agentName: string;     // The name of the agent whose LLM call is streaming.
  chunk: string;         // The piece of text received from the LLM stream.
                         // For `LLM_STREAM_CHUNK`, this is the delta. 
                         // For `LLM_STREAM_COMPLETE`, this might represent the full response if aggregated.
  isDelta: boolean;      // True if the chunk is a delta, false if it's a complete segment (less common for raw chunks).
  isComplete: boolean;   // True if this event signifies the end of the stream (used by `LLM_STREAM_COMPLETE`).
}
```

## `StreamingOptions` Interface

Defines options for operations that support streaming output, potentially offering a direct callback for chunks.

```typescript
export interface StreamingOptions {
  stream: boolean;                      // Whether to enable streaming for the operation.
  onChunk?: (chunk: string) => void;    // Optional callback function to be invoked with each string chunk of data 
                                        // as it is streamed. This is often used in conjunction with events like 
                                        // `AgentForgeEvents.LLM_STREAM_CHUNK` but can provide a more direct way
                                        // to process streamed text.
}
```
This interface can be used by higher-level functions or utilities within Agent Forge that wrap streaming operations. If an `onChunk` handler is provided, it typically receives the same string data as the `chunk` property of an `LLMStreamEvent`.
