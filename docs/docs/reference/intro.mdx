# Agent Forge API Reference

Welcome to the Agent Forge API Reference. This section provides detailed information about the classes, functions, types, and modules that make up the Agent Forge framework.

## Structure

The API reference is organized by modules, reflecting the core components of the framework:

*   **[Core](./core/):** Fundamental classes and utilities for agent creation and management.
*   **[LLM](./llm/):** Connectors and abstractions for interacting with Large Language Models.
*   **[Tools](./tools/):** Components for defining and using tools within your agents.
*   **[Utils](./utils/):** General utility functions used across the framework.
*   **[Types](./types/):** Shared TypeScript types and interfaces.

## Using This Reference

Each module section will contain:

*   An **Overview** page describing the module's purpose and key exports.
*   Detailed pages for individual classes, functions, and significant types, including parameters, return values, and usage examples where applicable.

## Contribution and Accuracy

This API reference is generated based on the framework's source code. While we strive for accuracy, the ultimate source of truth is the TSDoc comments within the codebase itself.

For a more dynamic and always up-to-date reference, consider generating the documentation locally using [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/) if you are working with the source code.
