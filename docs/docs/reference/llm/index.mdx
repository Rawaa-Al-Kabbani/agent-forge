This section provides reference documentation for Agent Forge's Large Language Model (LLM) integration capabilities.

The primary component for LLM interaction is the [`LLM`](./llm-class.mdx) class, which acts as a wrapper around various LLM providers, offering a unified interface for chat completions (streaming and non-streaming) and managing LLM configurations.

Key aspects covered:

*   **[`LLM` Class](./llm-class.mdx):** How to instantiate and use the `LLM` class for making requests to language models.
*   **Response Structures:** Understanding the [`LLMResponse`](./llm-class.mdx#llmresponse-interface) and [`LLMResponseToolCall`](./llm-class.mdx#llmresponsetoolcall-interface) interfaces.
