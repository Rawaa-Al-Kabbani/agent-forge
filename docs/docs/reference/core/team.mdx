The `Team` class represents a group of AI agents collaborating under the direction of a designated manager agent to accomplish a common goal. It orchestrates the interactions between the manager and member agents.

## `TeamRunOptions` Interface

Defines options for configuring the execution of a `Team`.

```typescript
export interface TeamRunOptions {
  /**
   * Maximum number of LLM calls allowed per minute across all agents in the team (default: no limit).
   * Useful for preventing API rate limit issues.
   */
  rate_limit?: number;

  /**
   * Enable detailed logging of communication between the manager and agents, 
   * including task assignments and intermediate results (default: false).
   * Useful for debugging team interactions.
   */
  verbose?: boolean;

  /**
   * Enable streaming of agent communications (default: false).
   * This allows for real-time observation of the team's progress.
   */
  stream?: boolean;

  /**
   * If `stream` is true, also stream output to the console (default: false).
   */
  enableConsoleStream?: boolean;
}
```

## `Team` Class

### Overview

The `Team` class allows you to define a hierarchical structure of agents where a `manager` agent delegates tasks to `member` agents. The team works collectively on an input task, with the manager planning, assigning sub-tasks, and synthesizing results from the members.

### Constructor

```typescript
constructor(manager: Agent, name: string = "Team", description: string = "A team of agents with a manager")
```

Creates a new `Team` instance.

*   **`manager: Agent`**: The [`Agent`](./agent.mdx) instance designated as the manager of this team.
*   **`name?: string`** (optional): The name of the team. Defaults to "Team".
*   **`description?: string`** (optional): A description for the team. Defaults to "A team of agents with a manager".

### Team Configuration Methods

#### `setName(name: string): Team`

Sets or updates the name of the team.

*   **`name: string`**: The new name for the team.
*   **Returns**: The `Team` instance for method chaining.

#### `setDescription(description: string): Team`

Sets or updates the description of the team.

*   **`description: string`**: The new description for the team.
*   **Returns**: The `Team` instance for method chaining.

#### `getName(): string`

Retrieves the current name of the team.

*   **Returns**: The team's name.

#### `getDescription(): string`

Retrieves the current description of the team.

*   **Returns**: The team's description.

### Agent Management Methods

#### `addAgent(agent: Agent): Team`

Adds a member [`Agent`](./agent.mdx) to the team.

*   **`agent: Agent`**: The [`Agent`](./agent.mdx) instance to add as a member.
*   **Returns**: The `Team` instance for method chaining.

#### `getAgent(name: string): Agent | undefined`

Retrieves a member agent from the team by its name.

*   **`name: string`**: The name of the agent to retrieve.
*   **Returns**: The [`Agent`](./agent.mdx) instance or `undefined` if not found.

#### `getAgents(): Agent[]`

Retrieves all member agents currently in the team.

*   **Returns**: An array of [`Agent`](./agent.mdx) instances.

#### `getManager(): Agent`

Retrieves the manager [`Agent`](./agent.mdx) of the team.

*   **Returns**: The manager [`Agent`](./agent.mdx) instance.

#### `setManager(manager: Agent): void`

Assigns a new manager [`Agent`](./agent.mdx) to the team.

*   **`manager: Agent`**: The new [`Agent`](./agent.mdx) instance to be the manager.

### Execution Method

#### `async run(input: string, options?: TeamRunOptions): Promise<AgentResult>`

Runs the team to accomplish the task defined by the `input`. The manager agent will devise a plan, assign tasks to member agents, and synthesize their outputs to produce a final result.

*   **`input: string`**: The overall task or problem statement for the team to address.
*   **`options?: TeamRunOptions`**: Optional parameters to configure the team's execution, such as rate limiting, verbose logging, or streaming. See [`TeamRunOptions`](#teamrunoptions-interface).
*   **Returns**: A `Promise` that resolves to an `AgentResult` object, containing the final output from the team's collaborative effort and metadata about the execution.

```typescript
// Example Usage (Conceptual)
import { Agent, Team, LLM } from "agent-forge";
// Assume managerAgent, researchAgent, writingAgent are existing Agent instances
// and OPENAI_API_KEY is available in environment variables

async function runTeamExample() {
  const llmProvider = new LLM("openai", { apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });
  
  // Define Agents (ensure they have LLM providers if not using AgentForge default)
  const managerConfig = { name: "ProjectManager", role: "Coordinator", objective: "Oversee project completion", model: "gpt-4", llm: llmProvider };
  const researchConfig = { name: "Researcher", role: "Information Gatherer", objective: "Find relevant data", model: "gpt-4", llm: llmProvider };
  const writerConfig = { name: "Writer", role: "Content Creator", objective: "Write reports", model: "gpt-4", llm: llmProvider };

  const managerAgent = new Agent(managerConfig);
  const researchAgent = new Agent(researchConfig);
  const writingAgent = new Agent(writerConfig);

  // Create and configure the team
  const projectTeam = new Team(managerAgent, "AI Project Team", "Team to research and report on AI topics.");
  projectTeam.addAgent(researchAgent);
  projectTeam.addAgent(writingAgent);

  const task = "Generate a report on the future of AI in education.";
  
  try {
    console.log(`Running team '${projectTeam.getName()}' for task: "${task}"`);
    const result = await projectTeam.run(task, { verbose: true, stream: true, enableConsoleStream: true });
    console.log("\nTeam Final Output:", result.output);
    if (result.metadata.toolCalls) {
      console.log("Total Tool Calls in Team execution:", result.metadata.toolCalls.length);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error running team:", error);
  }
}

runTeamExample().catch(console.error);
```

The `Team` class relies on the [`Agent`](./agent.mdx) class for its members and manager. Refer to the [`Agent`](./agent.mdx) API documentation for details on agent configuration and capabilities.
