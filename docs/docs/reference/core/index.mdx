# Core Module

The Core module of Agent Forge lays the groundwork for creating, configuring, and running AI agents. It is central to the framework's operation, housing the primary abstractions and orchestration logic.

Key components and responsibilities within the Core module typically include:

*   **`AgentForge` Class:** This is often the main entry point and central orchestrator for the framework. Your application code initializes an `AgentForge` instance, usually providing it with a default LLM provider. The `AgentForge` instance is then responsible for:
    *   Loading agent definitions (e.g., from YAML files via a method like `loadAgent`).
    *   Managing a `ToolRegistry` where tools are registered and made available to agents.
    *   Potentially managing an `MCPManager` for integrating tools from external Model Context Protocol servers.
    *   Creating and running execution units like individual agents, `Workflow`s, or `Team`s.

*   **`Agent` Class:** The fundamental representation of an AI agent. Each `Agent` instance encapsulates:
    *   Its identity and persona (name, role, description, objective).
    *   Configuration for interacting with an LLM (model, temperature, assigned `LLM` provider instance).
    *   A list of tools it can use.
    *   The core logic for executing tasks, which involves using its LLM and tools to achieve its objectives.

*   **`Workflow` Class:** Enables sequential execution of agents. You add agents as steps in a workflow, and Agent Forge manages the flow of execution and data between them.

*   **`Team` Class:** Facilitates hierarchical execution. A `Team` consists of a manager agent and one or more member agents. The manager delegates tasks to members to achieve a common goal.

*   **`ToolRegistry`:** A central repository for all tools available within an `AgentForge` instance. Agents consult this registry (or are provided tools from it) to perform actions.

*   **Configuration Loading:** Utilities to parse agent definitions, typically from YAML files (e.g., `loadAgentFromYaml` or similar functionality within `AgentForge`).

This section aims to provide detailed documentation for these core classes and their functionalities, including constructors, methods, and properties.

*(Specific API details for classes like `Agent`, `AgentForge`, `Workflow`, `Team`, etc., will be populated based on `src/core` contents or TypeDoc generation.)*
