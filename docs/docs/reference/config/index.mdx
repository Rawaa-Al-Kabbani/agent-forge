This section covers utilities related to loading configurations within Agent Forge, primarily focusing on how agent definitions are loaded from YAML files.

Key utilities include:

*   **YAML Loading Functions (`./yaml-loader.mdx`):**
    *   `loadAgentConfigFromYaml`: Loads and validates an agent's configuration from a single YAML file.
    *   `loadAgentFromYaml`: Loads, validates, and instantiates an `Agent` from a single YAML file.
    *   `loadAgentsFromDirectory`: Loads all agents defined in YAML files within a specified directory.

These functions provide flexibility in how you manage and instantiate your agent configurations, especially when dealing with file-based definitions.
